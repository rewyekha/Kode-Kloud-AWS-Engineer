# Day 12: Attach Volume to EC2 Instance

The Nautilus DevOps team has been creating a couple of services on AWS cloud. They have been breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process. Recently they came up with requirements mentioned below.

An instance named `datacenter-ec2` and a volume named `datacenter-volume` already exists in `us-east-1` region. Attach the `datacenter-volume` volume to the `datacenter-ec2` instance, make sure to set the device name to `/dev/sdb` while attaching the volume.

> **Note:** Run `showcreds` on the `aws-client` host to retrieve temporary AWS credentials, then configure the AWS CLI using `aws configure`.

**Notes:**

* Create the resources only in `us-east-1` region.
